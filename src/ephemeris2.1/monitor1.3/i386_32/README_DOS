The dos 16 bit version of the monitor program is in the dosmon subdirectory,
but those files should not be edited directly from unix since they are would
need to be converted with unix2dox first. At any rate, it is pointless since
the dos version needs to be managed under dos. 

Whenver the unix version is uddated the dos version should be kept in sync. 
Assuming this is going to be done under an emulator (e.g. bochs or dosemu) 
the simplest thing is just to copy the zip file dosmon12.zip to the
unix filesystem emulated drive and then copy the zipfile from there running
under the emulator. Copy it to a dedicated directory (e.g. C:\src\monitor)
and unzip in there with pkunzip -d dosmon12.zip. 

keep the version of dosmon12.zip here up to date with any changes made under the
emulator.

Try maker if make doesn't work. It is the real mode version.
