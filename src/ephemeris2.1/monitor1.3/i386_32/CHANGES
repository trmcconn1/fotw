1.0 -> 1.1:

	- Implemented external save command 
	- Command line processing and -e option

1.1 -> 1.2:

	- Fixed bug in set command. Did not properly remove a string
          that was set previously

	- added code to store arguments to monitor as env vars $0, $1, ...
          at startup 

	- allow scripts to access their argv as $0, $1, ...

	- cleaner exit from monitor that allows for return value
          from exit command. (we used to exit via linux system call) 

	- fixed bug in if processing: didn't properly clean stack after
          call to library routine

	- implemented new "exec" internal command to allow for shell out

	- implemented new "cd" internal command to change monitor's wd

	- upgraded the 16 bit dos version accordingly.

1.2 -> 1.3:

	- Monitor has proved to be problematic as a drop in for other 
          applications that need a command line. The problem is 
	  lack of portability (most of monitor is written in i386 assembly
	  language and won't build for other chips, for example the arm
	  family.) This lack of portablility infects every application 
          built around monitor. Version 1.3 now has monitor.c, lib.c, and
          internal.c, which should be used instead of their .a versions when
          monitor is incorporated in an application.
