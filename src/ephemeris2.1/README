Ephemeris is a command line tool for creating ephemerides from given
orbital elements. It maintains a library of orbital elements (sun, planets,
etc) which can be enlarged by gathering input in a dialog with the user.

The ephemeris command line interface is provided by incorporating my 
monitor program. Giving the help command at the monitor prompt provides
a list of available commands; "help command_name" gives more specific 
information on the usage and purpose of that command. 

INSTALLATION

Edit the Makefile appropriately for your platform and say make. Then
move the resulting executable (ephemeris) to an appropriate folder on 
your system. Ephemeris will use a startup configuration file named
.ephemeris2.rc in your home directory. The path to a startup file can
also be given on the command line (ephemeris -h provides usage information.)
You may, if you wish, edit the supplied ephemeris2.rc and copy to your
home directory. Ephemeris will run without a startup file.

This is free software offered as-is in the hope that some may find it
useful. Use at your own risk.
