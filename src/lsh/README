lsh: little shell

This is mainly a demo monitor-based app. When I wrote monitor1.0 and monitor1.1
they were designed to implement a lightly featured command processor that
could be easily incorporated into a larger application in need of a command line
interface. Unfortunately I wrote most of the code in nasm assembly language
(in order to become more familiar with nasm.) This makes for interesting but
highly non-portable code - exactly what I didn't want. Accordingly, I set out
to rewrite all of the monitor in c.  

See the README in the monitor1.3 directory (which should always be included
in any application based on monitor) for further information.
