Subject: Mintools bug?

Hi Terry,

I haven't fully tested the mintools package yet, but I ran into a problem
fairly early on. Sometimes I get very bizarre results with m2ls. 

Here is my Minix root as seen by Minix ls -l:

total 31
drwxr-xr-x  2 bin      operator      480 Nov 27 16:28 bin

drwxrwxr-x 16 root     operator      304 Nov 26 11:17 usr

And here it is as seen by mintools m2ls -l:

The core entry is a deleted file. Etc is, of course, a directory. I see
the exact same meaningless entries for mode, owner, group, size and date
for between 10% and 20% of the entries in a larger directory, as well.
At least some of these files are real undeleted files. The file names seem
correct even when the other data is nonsense.

It's pretty late at night, I'm not in shape for pursuing this further
right now. Tomorrow I'll play some more and see if I can figure out where
the garbage comes from. 

For whatever it is worth, here is what m2super -a shows me:

Minix V2 Filesystem hd4a: (disk  0x80, partition index 5)

Starting sector of filesystem = 1721665
Partition size = 0 bytes = 0 blocks = 0 sectors

Relevant fields in super-block (decimal,unless noted):

s_nzones         = 0     Total device size, including bitmaps etc

s_zmap_blocks    = 1     # of blocks used by zone bit map

s_magic          = 2468  (Hex) magic number to recognize super-blocks 
s_zones          = 1440  number of zones (replaces s_nzones in V2) 
------------------

s_zones          = 1440  number of zones (replaces s_nzones in V2) 
------------------

Minix V2 Filesystem hd4c: (disk  0x80, partition index 7)

Starting sector of filesystem = 1727425
Partition size = 0 bytes = 0 blocks = 0 sectors

Relevant fields in super-block (decimal,unless noted):

s_zones          = 197279        number of zones (replaces s_nzones in V2) 
------------------

I think this is correct, except for the 0,0,0 partition size. My hd4 is a
1.1G disk.

Sorry to report bad news. I am not complaining, I'm really glad you took
this on. I hope I can help you figure out what the problems are.
