Changes .01 --> .02

	1) Changed the signature of browse from
		char *browse(char *)
	   to
		int browse(char *)

	   This way the browser can indicate something about the selection
           while returning the selection itself through the pointer
           argument.

	2) Typing e or E while in the right pane now forces an edit of
           the selected file.

	3) Added visual cue to the nature of a file in the right pane.
           Thus, executable files end in *, directories in /, etc.
	   (Thanks to Claudio Tantignone for suggesting this.)

	4) Now we trap ^L and redraw entire stdscr if received.  

.02 --> .03

	1) Implement history list (forward/back) in browser. There
	   are 2 new supporting files: history.c and history.h.

	2) Fixed bug in Minix implementation: after reading a lone ^[ we
           weren't clearing the stdin eof indicator causing the next read
           to get eof.

	3) some commenting out in edit.c was poorly done. fixed that.

	4) fixed memory leak in xplore.c: weren't freeing memory malloc'd
           for new_argv.
          
	5) We didn't always reset value of is_psuedo in xplore.c. Fixed that.

.03 --> .04

	1) Implement p key-action to print selection.

	2) Implement m key-action to pipe output through more.

	3) Changed signature of browser yet again to 
                 int browse(void *)
	   in order to support multiple selection.

	4) Implement ^B keyaction in top window to browse for arguments.

	5) Changed signature of browse yet again, to
		int browse(void *, char *)
	    this time to support content of top pane that can be controlled
            from outside.

	6) Bug: unused escape sequences were being treated as escape char.
           Now we ignore them.

	7) Implement anchoring and highlighting to support multiple 
           selection in right pane.

	8) Fixed BIG memory leak: we weren't using FreeRight or FreeLeft
           in xplore.c. Something accidentally deleted earlier?

	9) Added loop over multiple selections in xplore.c
