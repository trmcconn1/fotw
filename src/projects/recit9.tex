The following  problem is to be worked in groups. The groups for
this recitation are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Group I: E. Miller, Newell, Chawan
\item Group II: Hobbs, Davis, Taylor
\item Group III: S. Miller, Willey, Champagne 
\end{itemize}

Work on scrap paper together, and then write up the final solution  
and hand in.

Problem: Create an hour examination on the same material as covered by the
test you took last week. Also, write an answer key to go along with the
test that spells out how partial credit would be awarded if a student taking
the test does not get the right answer. 

\smallskip
You should try to make your test reasonable and fair. It should cover the
material fairly completly, and yet be doable by students such as yourselves
in 50 minutes' time.
Do not make a test that is
too easy or too hard: if you do, it may come back to haunt you at some
future date.
