\bigskip
The following  problems are to be worked in groups. The groups for
this recitation are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Group I: S. Miller, Chawan,  Willey
\item Group II: Hobbs, Taylor, Davis 
\item Group III: Newell, E. Miller, Champagne
\end{itemize}

Work on scrap paper together, and then write up the final solution on this
sheet and hand in. (You can use another sheet of paper if there is not
room on this one.)

\bigskip
Problem 1: Let $u,v$ and $w$ be nonzero vectors in space. Show that there are
numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that the vector $z = u - \alpha v -
\beta w$ is perpendicular to the plane containing $v$ and $w$.
\smallskip
\par
Suggestion: Maybe you want to choose $\alpha$ and $\beta$ so that
$z\cdot v = z\cdot w = 0.$

Problem 2: Demonstrate {\bf Lie's Identity:} For any 3 vectors $u,v$ and $w$ 
in space,
$$
(u\times v)\times w + (w \times u)\times v + (v \times w) \times u = 0.
$$
\smallskip
\par Suggestions: First think about the case where some pair of vectors is
parallel. Then think about about the case where all 3 vectors are
perpendicular. Then think about what problem 1 might have to do with it.
