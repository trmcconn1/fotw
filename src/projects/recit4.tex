\bigskip
The following  problems are to be worked in groups. The groups for
this recitation are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Group I: S. Miller, Taylor, Newell 
\item Group II: Chawan, Champagne, Davis 
\item Group III: Willey, E. Miller, Hobbs
\end{itemize}

Work on scrap paper together, and then write up the final solution on this
sheet and hand in. (You can use another sheet of paper if there is not
room on this one.)

Flight 110 out of Dallas Fort-Worth follows a linear trajectory so that
its position (relative to some origin) at time t is given by the
parametric equations
$$
x = t, y = 3t -5, z = 2 + 2t.
$$
Meanwhile, flight 344 out of Houston has trajectory
$$
x = 3t -2, y = t - 1, z = 4 - 2t.
$$

Problem 1: How far apart are the aircraft at their point of closest 
approach? (Assume distance is measured in miles.)

Problem 2: How far apart are the trajectories of the aircraft ?
\vskip .1 in
Suggestions: Problem 2 asks you to find the distance between two skew lines
in space. Argue that the shortest line segment between two such lines must
be perpendicular to both lines.
