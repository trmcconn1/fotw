{\bf Comments on recitation 4 work.}
\vskip 1 in
You all reduced the problem of finding the distance between skew lines to
the problem of finding the distance from a point to a given plane. An
alternative method is given on the attached page.

Curiously, two groups gave the answer to part (a) as a decimal, but not
part (b). Note that $\frac4{\sqrt{3}} = 2.309\dots < \frac{\sqrt{22}}3 =
2.707\dots $. This reflects the fact that the two aircraft do not
arrive simultaneously at the respective endpoints of the shortest line
segment between their trajectories.

In part (a) it is equivalent, and somewhat simpler, to minimize the square
of the distance between the aircraft.

Group 1 did a very nice job of presenting the solution clearly and
correctly. Please, all of you take a look at their solution.
