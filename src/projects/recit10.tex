\bigskip
The following  problem is to be worked in groups. The groups for
this recitation are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Group I: Willey, Taylor, Chawan
\item Group II: S.Miller, Willey,Newell 
\item Group III: E.Miller, Hobbs, Champagne 
\end{itemize}

Work on scrap paper together, and then write up the final solution  
and hand in.

Problem 1: Calculate the 4-dimensional volume (``hypervolume'') of the
unit sphere in 4 dimensions. 
\vskip .1 in
You don't need to know anything about hypervolume to do this problem -- just
reason by analogy with 3 dimensions. There will be 4 iterated integrals
and the inner 3 will have limits of integration that sweep out 
3-dimensional spheres of radii that vary from 0 to 1.

Problem 2: In an earlier recitation you worked with a regular tetrahedron.
Calculate the volume of this tetrahedron if the side length is 1.
