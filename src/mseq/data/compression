The first few compression numbers.

c_1 = 1
c_2 = 0.75
c_3 = 0.75
c_4 = 0.875
c_5 = 0.9375
c_6 = 0.9375
c_7 = 0.945312
c_8 = 0.96875
c_9 = 0.974609
c_10 = 0.990234
c_11 = 0.969727
c_12 = 0.996338
c_13 = 0.98291
c_14 = 0.994385           

Unfortunately, this shoots the conjecture that compression must increase
monotonically.
