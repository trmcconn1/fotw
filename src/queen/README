				Queen 1.0
			   By Terry R. McConnell


Queen is a suite of command line programs for doing number theoretic
calculations. The name is of course inspired by the old saw that mathematics
is the queen of science and number theory is the queen of mathematics.
Writing these programs is a learning exercise: at present the package is
small and not very sophisticated, but hopefully both of those shortcomings
will go away over time. 

All programs respond to command line options -h, which prints usage information,
and -v, which prints the verion number. Hopefully this makes them self
documenting.

Following is a list of programs currently in the package and what they do:

eratosthenes: list primes numbers using the eponymous sieve.
euclid:       find lcd and related things.
factor:       factor integers.
farey:        generate farey sequences.
happy:        identify "happy" numbers.
linear:       solve linear congruences.
quadratic:    solve quadratic congruences.
totient:      calculate the Euler phi function.

To build the package on a Unix compatible system say make all at the
command line while in the current directory. If all goes well that should
do it. If all does not go well you're on your own.

Enjoy.
