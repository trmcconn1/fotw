1. What is edlin ?

Edlin, more precisely edlin.com, was the text editor bundled with MS-DOS
prior to version 5.0. From version 5.0 to version 6.0 edlin was bundled as
part of the \dos directory, but was effectively made obsolete by the newer
full screen editor known as "edit". From version 6.0 onward edlin was not 
part of the official distribution at all. Windows 95 actually expunges it 
(if found,) probably  because edlin is incompatible with the new file system. 
(Edlin was available to DOS 6.0 users on a supplemental disk. It is available
in Windows 95 on the CDROM in the OldDos directory.)

Edlin is a small program (7261 Bytes), and is, to put it gently, lightly 
featured. It allows the user to create, edit, and save text files, and may
also be used to edit binary files. It is a pure line editor, allowing 
manipulation of ranges of lines, direct entry of new lines, or editing of
an existing line.   Edlin operates in two main modes:   command mode and 
input mode. In command mode its behaviour is quite similar to the Unix line 
editor ( ed(1) ). In input mode the user may enter and edit a line using the
standard DOS command-line editing keys. ( This greatly simplifies the program:
it needs only to request an input line and the DOS CON driver handles the
rest. In Unix the program must emulate the required portion of the CON driver's
behaviour. ) The editing capability that is provided, mainly through the
PC keyboard function keys, is complete but counter-intuitive  (some would say,
bizzare.)   

2. Why deadlin ?

OK, after that lukewarm introduction you should ask, "Why would anyone want
to write an edlin clone?"  For an amateur programmer it is an excellent
exercise. In programming there are two first steps: (1) define what the program
is supposed to do, and (2) design and create code to implement the usage defined
in (1). I'm willing to bet most programmers would rather spend their time
doing (2) than (1). With edlin the definition is already specified in perfect 
detail: mimic its behaviour as much as possible. Thus, the student
is free to focus on the important things, such as designing good data 
structures, writing compact, efficient, clear code, and isolating system
dependant from portable code. 

Secondly, like it or not, edlin is a milestone in the history of 
micro-computing. For many years it was the only way users of stock MS-DOS
could create and maintain text files. I had this vision of the not-too-distant
future -- when the last 386 DX had vanished from garage sales, the last
pre 4.0 DOS partition been erased, and the last 5 1/4 inch floppy 
lost its magnetization in a dusty drawer -- that edlin.com might pass utterly
from this earth... and I was saddened.  So you could consider this my one
contribution to SOFTWARE PRESERVATION. 

Finally, edlin is actually a good tool for certain tasks such as creating
long lists of lines that only differ from each other in a few characters.

3. What are differences between deadlin and the real edlin?

The main differences are (consult the included man page for details) :

3a. A few things are done the Unix way. 

	-^D instead of ^Z for end of file.
	-Use of printer spool system for ^P.
	-Use of hyphens to begin command-line options.
	-The working directory returns to its original value
         after the program exits.
	-Control characters are echoed with ^ before the letter 
         rather than after as in DOS. They are printed correctly.
	-The maximum number of characters on a line (including the
         newline ) is 254, not 253. (254 + newline + terminating null
         = 256, a good buffer size.) DOS lines are terminated by
         two characters -- A CR and LF.

3b. There are two  new command-line options: -m <bytes>, which allows deadlin to
immitate the limited memory environment of early DOS releases; and -t <n>
which informs the program when tab stops are set at intervals of n columns
rather than the default 8 columns. Note that this option does not actually
set tabs. That must be done with an external program, e.g. tset.

3c. Use of control keys instead of function keys.  Many Unix systems don't
even have function keys, but all terminals in recorded history can generate
the 32 control characters. ( If you do have function keys, consult section
5 below for how you can configure deadlin to use them instead of control
characters. )

3d. The Alt key (or, more precisely, its control character equivalent) can
be used in conjunction with the numeric keypad to enter extended ascii
characters. Unlike edlin, the ordinary number keys can also be used.
Moreover, it is impossible in Unix to emulate the DOS behaviour exactly,
since it is impossible to test whether a given key has been released. (Dos
translates extended characters only when the user releases the Alt key.)

3e. We don't implement the DOS critical error handler that prints Abort, Retry,
Fail? and waits for user input. This has no place in Unix since user processes
are unable to take any meaningful action in case a device is not ready.

3f. It is possible to include embedded newlines in lines but impossible
to search for them in the real edlin. Attempting to include either ^M or
^J in a search or replace string by using ^VM or ^VJ instead terminates
the command. We have chosen not to emulate this (incorrect) behavior. 

3g. I'm not sure how deadlin would handle the (rare) situation of
insufficient disk space to write the full edited file. You might end up with
only a fragment with extension $$$, or you might end up with a full .bak
file and a fragment with extension $$$. Or, you might end up with nothing :-(.

4. Why is deadlin so large?

	The real edlin was probably written in 8086 assembly language.
Assembly language programs can be made much smaller than programs written in
C . Moreover, a considerable amount of extra code is needed to emulate
the DOS CON driver ( this code comprises the file readline.c ) 
Finally, (and it hurts me to say this,) the programmers who wrote the
original edlin were professionals, and much better programmers
than I am. 


5. How can I maximize my "edlin experience"?

	If your computer has 7 or more function keys, you can set up deadlin
to use them by following these outline steps (details vary by system):

a. Change your kernel's keymap. This is normally done by creating a special
file called a keymap file, which may either be flat text or a binary. 
Whatever the details are on your system, you create a file called (say)
edlin.map which contains lines specifying how keys map to 
characters. You should create such a file which maps the function keys to
the various control characters deadlin uses in place of them. (See the
man page for details. Also see the README in the keymaps directory.) 
Then you can use whatever command your system provides
to load the new keymap into the kernel, e.g, in Minix,

Minix> loadkeys /etc/keymaps/edlin.map

b. Write a shell-script wrapper (called, e.g. edlin.sh) which could
be used to launch deadlin after loading the new keymap. For example,

------------------------ edlin.sh -----------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
# 
# For Minix : adapt this to your system

# Load custom keymap for deadlin
loadkeys /usr/lib/keymaps/edlin.map 

# Execute deadlin with the arguments passed to this script
/usr/local/bin/deadlin $*

# Reload the standard keymap
loadkeys /usr/lib/keymaps/us-std.map 

#
exit 0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

c. Make a link from /usr/local/bin/edlin to edlin.sh

Some working keymaps for various systems are provided in the 
directory keymaps. There is also an edlin.sh for Linux.


6. If this is software preservation, how come no actual copies of edlin.com
   are included? 

	I'm not sure about the legality of that. 

7. Can I build this under MS-DOS?

	Yes, but what's the point?

8. What else is provided with this file ?

	This directory contains a standard Unix Makefile, the source code
files for deadlin, a document called INSTALL, a Unix-style manual page for
edlin, and a directory called keymaps for any contributed custom edlin
keymaps.

9. How can I build and install deadlin ?

	Consult the file called INSTALL.
