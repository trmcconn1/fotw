 Changes made during upgrade 1.0->1.1

 1.)Changed the definition of struct SlotList  so that the list
 of timeslots, the name, and the description are now dynamically allocated
 at runtime, thus saving about 70K of memory. This required rewriting the
 creatslotlist routine, changing numerous structure references, and writing
 a new routine in load.c to free a slotlist struct.

 2.) The index numbers that are displayed by dtimes, djobs, etc are now
 what you must type in order to see a given datum (rather than off by 1.)

 3.) Now we dynamically allocate the name field of a TimeSlot. This is
 only used by Holiday timeslots, so statically allocating 20 bytes for
 each slot's name was very wasteful. As a bonus, there is now no limit
 on the length of Holiday's name. A semester's worth of data now takes
 about 80K, and with the schedule it comes to a total of about 130K. 

 4.) Added a people choice to the View menu to allow the user to display
 ranges of people data.

 5.) Changed the dpeople printout to make it suitable to be distributed
 to people.

 6.) Put version number in title.

 7.) Updated version number everywhere it appears (main.c, info.txt).

 8.) Added a set menu entry to set the MissingData entry. Fixed bug in
 set command that kept MissingData from actually getting changed.

 9.) Added a LOADED shell variable that tells whether a semester is loaded.
    Changed status bar to tell us the loaded state.

10.) Edited all scripts so that they now save and restore semester and loaded
states.
