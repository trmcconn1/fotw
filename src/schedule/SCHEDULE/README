# README: general setup information for the scheduling programs           #

This directory should have been created automatically when the program
archive was extracted. It is a subdirectory called schedule of whatever
directory the archive was in when it was extracted.

This directory is the root directory of the math department scheduling
programs. It is the most logical choice for the working directory of the
programs.

The main programs:
schedule: manage the math department schedule. 
newsmstr: Begin the process of creating a new semester's schedule.

These programs have been built and tested under two varieties of Unix ( Linux
and NeXTStep ) with gcc 2.5.8,gcc 2.7.0, gcc 2.7.2 and MSDOS (Borland C/C++ 4.5) 

Description of contents of subdirectories:

src: contains the source code for the programs. To build the programs change
to each sub-directory and say make. The makefile also contains the target
"clean"

include: contains custom header files.

doc: program documentation including the man page, schedule.1., and latex
source for the user's guide, guide.tex.

examples: a sample configuration file (rcfile), and other miscellaneous stuff.

data: There should be one subdirectory in this directory for each semester's
data.  There should be one schedule batch file for each semester.

scripts: Auxiliary programs. These should not be touched by the user.

The dos batch file in this directory called makedist can be used to
make distribution disks or backups. It is interactive.

Installation: the executables can be put anywhere on the command search path.
(They can be put anywhere, but if not on the path then the full path to the
program must be given. ). In Unix, the configuration file ( see 
examples/rcfile ) should be put in the user's home directory and named 
.schedulerc, and a link to file doc/schedule.1 should be put in some 
directory on the user's MANPATH. In Dos, the configuration file should
be named schedule.rc and placed in any directory on the command search path.

Use schedule -help   to get a brief usage message and schedule  -version
to display the program version.
