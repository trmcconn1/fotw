Changes made during 1.4 -> 1.5

Changed the function AgeGroupNo defined in runner.cpp to compute a
runner's age on the date of a run rather than on May 15 in order to
conform with a rules change. This means we have to look at points
rather than times to determine a best run. 

Numerous changes to allow for the "participation" event implemented
in Fall 1996. Runners get one point for running in an XC event. No
times, the run counts as official.
- added instance variable int special and method void Addspecial(void)
to class runner
- implemented AddSpecial in runner.cpp
- code in load case DISTANCED to handle special return value (-1) from
parser
- code in ParseResults to return rinfo.EventIndex = -1 upon a distance
XC line in results, and to look only for a name field in the following
list of participants.
- In runner.cpp changed Printall to report whether runner had
participated, and changed the runner class extract operator to put a
+ next to names of participating runners in scorall.

We are going back to counting both 100m and 15k, so I commented out
the code in the AddRun method of runner.cpp that handled this (in case
it comes back.) 

Changes made during 1.5 -> 1.6

Made parsing of roster file much more failsafe: now if any fields are
missing we ignore the line and go on.

Extensively revamped gui.cc so it will work pretty well over any terminal.
