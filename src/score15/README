This is the Noontime Running League scoring program for Linux

The official code is on barnyard. Keep home linux code in sync.

There is still old code (including sourcefile gui.dos) for a dos
version, but it will probably not work anymore. (I still have the
original DOS code hanging around anyway.)

To change versions you need to edit the VERSION variable in makefile. Also
change in a couple of help strings in score.cc and in the file info.txt.

Keep the file rules.txt synced with the current one in the web directory. 

The program can be run in pure text mode using -q. Otherwise it uses the
interface defined in gui.cc, which is not entirely satisfactory over a
remote terminal -- read comments in gui.cc for further information.

IMPORTANT:
To add new age-groups, standards or events, read the detailed procedure
in source.txt. This can be quite tricky.

PROCEDURE FOR STARTING A NEW SEASON
1) Recode and recompile if necessary due to rule changes. Install in
/usr/local/bin
2) Edit .scorerc
3) Archive old roster.asc, scorall.asc,  results.asc from web directory
   as roster.yy, results.yy, and scorall.yy in both web directory and
   this one.
4) You might need to create temporary versions of roster.asc and results.asc
for testing. Edit .scorerc to point to them.
5) Create an new teams.yyyy in this directory. (Note: unlike the other
files, the yyyy in teams.yyyy is one year later.)
6) Edit patti's setup if necessary.
