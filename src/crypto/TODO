                	   Ideas for future versions

	- Make it easier to recompile all the programs for a different
          alphabet. (See utils/mkrotor which is already so configurable.) 
          This is probably a bit more difficult than just changing NCHARS and
          START_CHAR because some programs care about things like whether the
          alphabet size is even or odd.

	- DOS/WINDOWS port ?

	- A common library of statistical routines for analyzing output text.

	- A "cracking" program. Link in one of the encrypt routines and
          then implement a key search. It would be interesting to do this
          in multiple threads: one thread could try, e.g., all passwords
          from one of the standard cracker's libraries, while another is
          searching all strings up to a given length. We could adaptively
          home in on text that looks promising by passing a crude char
          frequency test. (Note the cracking is not at all the same thing
          as cryptanalysis. I don't want to get into cryptanalysis!)
