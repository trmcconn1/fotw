		 Important changes between versions

1.0 -> 1.1

	All encrypt routines now return at the end of the firstcall 
block. They are now called first thing in main to let the encryption
routines do initialization. (This is now needed  because the
new book cypher needs to size its input buffer based on the size of the
book, which cannot be done until run time.) 

	Implemented book and onetime cyphers.

	Created utils directory with new utility programs makebook, 
makepad, and mkrotor.

	Implemented enigma cypher (Any package of historical cyphers MUST
include enigma!)

1.1 -> 1.2

	Buffer memory is now dynamically allocated in main.c

	Implemented simple columnar transformation cipher

	Implemented Hill cypher


1.2 -> 1.3

	Implemented uuencode and support binary/printable conversions in
        utils.

	Implemented Feistel cipher as a first example of a block cipher

	Implemented freq utility in utils.	

1.3 -> 1.4

	Implemented cardano grille cipher.
