Ideas for future versions

- Port to Masm syntax and 16 bit format and Dos/windows platforms

- Implement a boot monitor version (16 bit standalone, relocatable format,
save command that saves to an offset on the disk, system calls replaced by
BIOS calls, external commands that boot a partition and give partition info.) 
This would need to have special boot sector code to find and boot it. It would
be similar to Minix 2 monitor. Indeed, monitor is inspired by that one.
