
This is a port of my monitor program to 16 bit DOS. You should consult the
README in the larger monitor package for operational details, since this
version is supposed to operate pretty much the same as the 32 bit Linux version.
The .asm files here are compatible with MASM, and the .c files should compile
with anything (I used Borland Turbo C). You may have to edit the makefile
if you are using another assember, compiler, or linker.

If you say make all then one target will be built:

- monitor.exe:  a small model program that should be identical in operation
                to the Linux version. Use -h option to see usage info.

Additionally, the bootmon directory contains source code for a stand-alone
version of the monitor that runs in the absence of an operating system. Also
included are boot blocks for floppy disk and a hard drive partition that find
and boot the monitor in this setting, and a master boot record that can be
used if the monitor is installed in the hidden blocks of the hard drive. The
boot monitor can be used to set up a multi-boot menu, similar to the
Minix 2 boot monitor, a program on which it is loosely based. To build the
boot monitor, change to the bootmon directory and say make all. Be very 
careful with the wrboot.exe program since it can overwrite the boot blocks
of the current hard drive!
