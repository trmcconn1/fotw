\centerline{Kepler's Laws}
\vskip .5 in
\item{1.} Planetary orbits are ellipses with the sun at one focus.
\vskip .5 in
\item{2.} The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out area at a
constant rate.
\vskip .5 in
\item{3.} The square of the orbital period (``year'') is directly proportional
to the cube of the major axis of the orbit.

$$
\frac{d^2{\bold r}}{dt^2} \ \ = \ \ -\mu\, \frac{{\bold r}}{r^3},
$$
\vskip .1 in
where ${\bold r}$ is the radius vector from the sun to the planet, and
$\mu = GM$, $G$ being the Gravitational Constant, and $M$ the mass of the 
sun.
