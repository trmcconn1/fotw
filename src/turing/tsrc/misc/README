This directory is just what it sounds like: a hodgepodge of various 
things.

Turing program source files:

parens.t:  Test whether a parenthesis expression is balanced.
prime.t:   Test whether a natural number is prime.
un2bin.t:  Convert unary to binary representation.
countup.t: List all natural numbers on the tape in binary form. (Runs
           forever.)

C program language source files:

lisper.c: Generate a balanced parenthesis expression at random. (Could be
          used to generate examples for parens.t.)
