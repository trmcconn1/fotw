lst2tape converts the output of turing -c -l to an initial tape for the
universal turing machine. It is suitable to be used only for programs whose
alphabet contains only two characters. Since all programs in the logic
collection have this property, lst2tape could be used to set up an initial
tape for simulating any of the programs there on the universal machine. 

Example: suppose we want to simulate the multiplication machine (mult.t)
operating on 2 and 3 (i.e., the computation of 2x3) on the universal machine.
First run turing with the -l option to generate a listing of the compiled
program, and capture the output in a file called foo:

turing -c -l mult.t > foo

Next, use lst2tape to convert the contents of foo into the code segment
part of an initial tape:

lst2tape < foo > bar

The file bar now contains one long string ending with * (the character the
universal machine uses to mark the end of the code segment of its tape.)
You must add the data portion of the tape yourself. Thus, in our example
you would append -1|-||B|||| to the contents of bar. Now make a turing
souce file called, e.g., test.t as follows:

# test.t: multiply 2x3 the long way

.include global.t
.tape [contents of bar here]
.include universal.t


Now run test.t with turing test.t.

To build lst2tape in the first place, just do make all in this directory.
