This directory contains source files for the online version of the Syracuse
University Algebra Competency Test. Each file with the .pg extension defines
a single problem and is to be used with the Webwork suite developed at the
University of Rochester. 

The .pg files are written in Perl using macros provided with Webwork. These
macros assist in generating valid html as well as in generation of forms
and answer evaluation. Together they form the basis of the "pg" (for problem
generation) language.

Files with .c extension are C source code files used to prove that multiple
choice answers in certain questions are unique. Compile them with
cc foo.c
and run a.out. If all goes well the program will print "You win!"

Design principles:

1) We have tried to make the test as close in spirit to the original version
as possible. This is important since the test serves as an advising instrument,
and placement exam score ranges for various placement advice ought not to
change.

2) Each question is multiple choice. In most problems, the answers are permuted
in the different versions in addition to the use of random "magic numbers."

3) No two possible answers can be the same.

4) The numbers appearing in the problem should not get too large. 

5) The display format ought to conform to standard algebraic notation. In 
particular, one must avoid -1,0, and 1 as coefficients or exponents. Also
the construction +- should be avoided. 


Reminders while creating new problems:

1) Make sure to change the .def file before destroying and rebuilding the
problem sets.

2) Make sure to chown tmc.ACPTEST the new .pg file
