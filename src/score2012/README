This is the README for the linux version of
noontime league scoring program. 

We assume the official installation is the one on my
laptop, so whenver you change that version of score12 this
one needs to be synced with the source and rebuilt with make score

The official up to date data files are the ones in the league
web directory. Run the shell script cpdata to update the ones in this
directory. This strips scores from the results file and converts
both it and roster to unix format.

teams file needs to be maintained manually

Don't use output from this score in the league web directory unless
you process it through unix2dos

Program settings are in .scorerc in $HOME

score -help

gives some info about command line flags
