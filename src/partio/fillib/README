How to add a new filter to the library

1. copy and rename one of the source files to foo.c, say
2. rewrite foo.c to do the job you want
3. Add foo.o to the list of objects in the Makefile
4. Add a declaration for the new filter to ../partition.h
5. Add the appropriate structure entry in manager.c

Please make filenames 8.3 compliant to ease the Dos port
