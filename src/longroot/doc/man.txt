NAME

	longsqrt_standalone
	longcurt_standalone
	longsqrt.cgi	

SYNOPSIS

	longsqrt_standalone [ -h -v ] <radicand> <digits>

	longcurt_standalong [ -hv --] <radicand> <digits>

	longroot.cgi

DESCRIPTION

	Longsqrt_standalone prints the results of the by-hand calculation
	of the square root of the radicand  with the given number
	of digits in the decimal answer. Longcurt is similar, except that
	the cube root is calculated. Longroot.cgi provides a cgi web
	interface to these routines. 


OPTIONS

	-h: Print usage information and exit 

	-v: Print version number and exit

	--: Signal the end of options so that a negative radicand can
	    be given.

USAGE

	The radicand is to be given in decimal format, i.e. in the form
	[-][0..0][d...d][.d..d] where d...d denotes zero or more decimal
	digits. A minus sign is only allowed by the cube root routine. 
	Leading and trailing zeros are accepted, but ignored. The digits
	argument must be a natural number in decimal format. There is
	no limit on the length of these arguments ( and on the amount of
	output produced ) except for any imposed by the operating 
	environment. 

	The two command line programs write their output to stdout and
	error messages to stderr. The cgi script writes both to stdout. 

	Longroot.cgi is normally run by the web server as a cgi (Common
	Gateway Interface) script. It expects to find REQUEST_METHOD and
	CONTENT_LENGTH defined in its environment. REQUEST_METHOD must
	have the value POST, and the server must support the post
	method. The value of CONTENT_LENGTH, if positive, is ignored. 	
	The script then reads a string on stdin that encodes the
	arguments in the format 

		RADICAND=<decimal>&NDIGITS=<decimal>&ROOT=<[2,3]> 

	This content is normally provided to the web server by a client
	in response to <FORM> ... </FORM> tags in an html document sent
	from the server. 

	If there are no errors, the same output as would be produced
	by the longsqrt_standalone (if ROOT=2) or by the longcurt_standalone
	program (if ROOT=3) is printed to stdout. This output would then
	by forwarded as a document by the server back to the same client
	that submitted the POST request.
