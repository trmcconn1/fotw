I will provide a zip archive, longroot.zip, containing the following files:

- longsqrt.c:   C source code for square root algorithm.
- longcurt.c:   C source code for cube root algorithm. 
- longroot.htm: html format documentation for the programs.
- Possibly some additional source files and header files.
- Console mode windows XP executables longsqrt.exe and longcurt.exe
- Linux executables longsqrt and longcurt
- Unix style Makefile

The package will compile without warnings under both gcc 2.96 and Microsoft
Visual C++ version 2002.

The executables run in console mode and accept two parameters (and possibly
certain options) on their command lines: The radicand and a natural number
indicating the number of significant digits in the desired result. They
will print to their stdout text that gives a "prettyprint" rendering of
the by-hand calculation. For example, given input 2.0 and 3 the
longsqrt program would output

            1. 4  1
           ___________________________
          /
       \/   2.00 00
            1

            -------

or something similar. The cube root output would be similar, but with zeros
grouped in threes, and more complex estimate work down the right column. 

Both programs would use dynamic memory management so as to insure that they
would (in principle) work to arbitrary precision. No postprocessing will
be done on the output -- it is assumed that the display can handle the
number of columns produced.
