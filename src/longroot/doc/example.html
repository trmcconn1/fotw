The square root of a positive number may be extracted by hand using the 
following procedure:
<P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI> Group the digits to the left of the decimal in pairs with possibly a
first incomplete pair.
<LI> Similarly pair digits to the right of the decimal point. Complete any
last incomplete pair with a zero.
<LI> Append additional zero pairs so that the total number of pairs is
equal to the desired number of digits in the answer.
<LI> Estimate the (1 digit) square root of the leftmost pair. This is the
first digit of the result.
<LI> Form the first <strong> partial.</strong> (The partials are listed along
the left margin in the example below.)
<LI> Double the answer digits obtained so far: these are the most significant
digits of the the next partial. The least significant digit is obtained by
estimation. (It is shown with an underscore.)
<LI> The estimated digit is the largest such that its product with the
completed partial is less than or equal to the current radicand.
<LI> The largest such product is the next subtrahend. It is written underneath
the current radicand.
<LI> Subtracting the subtrahend produces the next radicand.
<LI> Repeat until the desired number of digits are generated.

<H3>Cube Roots </H3>
<P>
One begins by grouping the radicand digits to the left of the decimal
point in threes (with the most significant digits possibly forming a partial
group of 1 or 2.) The mechanics are similar in outline to those of
the square root algorithm (see above) except for the formation of
the partials. Each (total) partial is the sum of a major and a minor partial.
The major is gotten by multiplying the <STRONG> square </STRONG> of the current result digits
by 300.  The minor partial is the product of
the next result digit and the minor factor. The minor factor is gotten by
multiplying the current result digits by 30, where the trailing zero is to
be replaced by the next result digit. Finally, the next result digit is
the largest possible digit such that its product with the resulting total
partial will not exceed the current radicand.
