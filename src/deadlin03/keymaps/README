Suggested keyboard mappings 

The following keymaps should be made to make keys function as much as
possible like they do in DOS:

F1 --> ^W
F2 --> ^L
F3 --> ^A
F4 --> ^R
F5 --> ^T
F6 --> ^D
Esc -> ^[
Backspace -> ^H (or ^? on some systems)
Control-Break -> ^C
Del -> ^? (or ^H on some systems)
Control-PrintScrn -> ^P
Ins -> ^E
Alt -> ^U

The philosophy behind the following is that if the user has mapped the
function keys to the control character operations, then she will want to
get the actual control characters rather than their actions when the
characters themselves are entered from the keyboard. 

Control-E --> ^VE
Control-W --> ^VW
Control-L --> ^VL
Control-A --> ^VA
Control-R --> ^VR
Control-T --> ^VT
Control-U --> ^VU
Control-Alt -> Alt

For example, pressing the control key and the U key simultaneously 
should send the two-character string ^VU. When entered in edlin
this will store ^U internally.

                     (Notes on Keymaps provided)

Linux or FreeBsd US keyboard (For Text Console)
==========================================================================

To use the keymap provided in this directory use the loadkeys -s command.
(In FreeBsd use the kbdcontrol -l command) 
This may be included in a script as illustrated in the files edlin.sh (linux)
and edlin.fbd for freebsd. These should be edited and moved as edlin to
an appropriate place on your path.) Note that ^T and
^U print as alternate OEM characters, but this is impossible to emulate
here. This includes all of the above keymaps. Note that many keys are
mapped in the default keymaps to do special things. These mappings
have not been removed. Because of the mapping of ALT --> ^U you won't
be able to switch virtual consoles using the alt key.  Instead, the
map has been set up so you can use Control-Alt instead to switch VTs.

All of this is very much keyboard dependent so these maps should only be
regarded as examples. (I made these maps using a laptop so, for
example there is no numpad at all and ins/del are in a weird
place. There are utilities that can give scancodes for keys
you strike (in freebsd, e.g., there is a useful port named kbdscan for this
purpose. Linux has showkeys(1) and a dumpkeys(1) routine, which you can also use
to capture a current keymap to use for restoring the original
keymap when edlin exits. ) 

Unfortunately loading the keymap under linux seems to require root
priveleges. Loading function key strings does not require root priveleges
but any reassignment of key codes most likely will. (On my laptop, for
example, the del key sends a scan code that is associated with the
keypad period character, and this code needs to be reassigned to send the
appropriate delete character.) There are two fixes, neither completely
satisfactory: 1) run edlin as su root; 2) make loadkeys suid root. 

Xresources 
=========================================================================

These provide keymapping resources for the standard Xterm. They should
be loaded using xrdb, e.g.
xrdb -merge Xresources
before launching an xterm from which edlin will be run. (See the example
shell script "edlin.lnx" in the directory above this one.)

Minix.map (For Minix 2. Haven't tried with Minix 3.)
=========================================================================

This is a binary which must be produced from the source file minix.src.
The method is the following(if you want to make changes):
1) copy the file /usr/src/kernel/keymaps/genmap.c to the current directory.
2) give the commands

cc -DKEYSRC\"minix.src\" genmap.c
a.out > minix.map
  
Note that minix does not support mapping keys to emit strings. Thus the
method outlined above for remapping control characters to enter strings
beginning with LITERAL (^V) will not work. We have opted instead to turn
off the control character production altogether so that the user won't get
surprising results. Thus, e.g., striking CTRL-A will just produce A rather
than ^A and its attendant action. 

I had no success figuring out how to map Control-Break and Control-PrintScr
in Minix. Of course, the normal minix "Hot Keys" F1-F3 will no longer
work. (You might fix this, if it annoys you, by mapping F7-F9 to function
as hot keys.)

Be sure to read the keymap(5) man page. 

Of course, almost nobody uses minix 2, but those who do might be more inclined
to use edlin than a normal person :-)
