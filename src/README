This is Terry McConnell's code base (mostly c code)

misc has various things including standalone .c files. The other folders are
more extended projects (some worthless, some ok). Most folders have their
own makefile and readme. 

For best results keep the original of this code base as a reporitory on
github.com and clone for your various machines, but keep synced with the
repository.

expat, slirp, and mtwist were not written by me, so if you any code from
them make sure to adhere to the copyright.
