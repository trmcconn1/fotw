This is Terry McConnell's code base (mostly c code)

misc has various things including standalone .c files. The other folders are
more extended projects (some worthless, some ok). Most folders have their
own makefile and readme. 

For best results keep the original of this code base as a reporitory on
github.com and clone for your various machines, but keep synced with the
repository.

This is all my own code except for the Mersenne twistor code in mtwist-1.2.
This code is covered under the GPL so make sure to include the entire source
files with license header with any source or binary package that uses it.
I've only used it in two minor projects so far (dally and hash). Probably
best to avoid using in the future unless absolutely necessary. (Most unix-like
systems now include their own entropy generator so the existing rngs are
most likely good enough for practical purposes.)
